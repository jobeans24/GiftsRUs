## Description
The Gifts R Us gift registry application presents users with a site that will allow them to connect to a specific event registry. Once connected to the event the user will be able to see all the items that are available for purchase or that have already been purchased. Users will also be able to split costs of the items between multiple attendees, and the items that have partically been paid for will be presented with the remaining cost.
The application allows attendees to events to get a clear option choice of what to get the honorees of the celebration through a free public application.
